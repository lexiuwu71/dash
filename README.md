# D.A.S.H
-# Digtial Access and Service Hub

## To install
Install a fresh copy of Alpine Linux
Get D.A.S.H onto your computer somehow (through git, wget, usb, cdrom) (the installer works completely offline and doesn't rely on any server, *except* alpine's repo, but i will be adding a script to create a package cache in a later version)

## This is still in development, so definitaly dont try to install it on any main system :P
